## Mock Interviews

During this module, fellows will participate in two or more mock interviews. This is what you will be evaluated on:

- Ready to go:
  - You are in a location that is conducive for an interview (quiet, good internet, ability to turn camera and microphone on)
  - You have other programs closed, your screen is ready to share, and you are prepared to start the interview immediately
- Discussion question: This will be based on the behavioral questions you have been learning and reviewing in the PBD/IR sessions. There is also a list of possible questions available inside the Mock Interviews guide repository
- Trivia question: Every lesson in this unit has a few trivia questions. One (or a similar one) will be chosen from the list. This is to help you practice talking about code concepts.
- Code Challenge: You will be given a code challenge. You should follow the problem-solving methodologies you have been taught. Demonstrating your problem-solving skills and ability to talk about code is essential.

## Peer-to-Peer Mock Interviews

In addition to having interviews with your instructors, you will have opportunities to practice interviewing each other. This will also help you understand what it feels like to be on the other side of the interview, which should help clarify what interviewers are often looking for.
